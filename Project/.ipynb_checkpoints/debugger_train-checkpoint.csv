2,The River of Doubt: expedition and metaphor,"The River of Doubt is about both a journey of geographic exploration, and the challenges that people set for themselves. This expedition is as much about the individuals who took part as it is about the exploration of the river.Reading the book gave me a taste of the Amazonian rainforest, the dangers of unknown exploration and a sense of the courage of most of the participants.Clearly, both Theodore Roosevelt and Colonel Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon were extraordinarily talented men.It left me with a sense of sadness that this triumphant achievement did not bring a greater sense of fulfillment to most of the survivors.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
1,Many errors in both the book and the CD,"After reading the first few sections of the book, I abandoned it for more accurate resources due to the sheer number of factual and typographical errors I had found. The CD-based quiz also contained many errors--including test questions where interpretation of an EKG was required, but an image of an X-ray was shown, or vice versa. Out of 8 image interpretation questions, I counted only one where the picture matched the question stem and choices. Also, many of the ""explanation"" windows for the test questions did not really address why each choice was right or wrong, but just added another piece of trivia about the disorder. I feel the editing of both the book and CD need work, and the explanations for the answers should be more detailed. At most, this item could be used as an outline for study, while using other sources to check facts."
1,Screwed up mess of a movie,"I can't recall the last time I gave up on a movie ... I usually will suffer through anything just to get to the end. But I had to stop halfway through this.The ""official"" review says it gives a fresh perpective on what the future may look like, or some such nonsense. Give me a break.Good for kids? Whatever the producers were aiming at, I didn't get it, and I doubt my adopted 4 or 6 year old daughters would either. They would get the early scene about the main character's despair over ever being adopted, then they would have quickly lost interest in the confusing dialog that follows for the next 45 minutes and simply have been left with a very negative message about adoption.If I could give this a zero, I would."
1,this Hatchet needs to be replaced,"Oh the mere thought of someone trying to replace Danny Joe Brown just makes my skin crawl.Hey guys ya ever thought about Joe Lyn Turner from Rainbow[JUST KIDDING}Every song is bland obnoxious noise,and I feel pity on anyone who would spend their hard earn money to see them live let alone buy their cd's.Please REPLACE the singer before you guys bury yourself so deep there's no getting out."
1,A fine book with social flaws,"Hengeller is not only a redundant writer but an extremely poor one. If you need a sleeping pill, I urge you to read this book.It has some scholarly value. I'll give it that much. But with all the more interesting works done on the same subject matter, who really cares to read this. The only people who should read this must really love this subject, anyone else should consider this a rip off."
1,Makes a great Sieve!,"What's that? You didn't buy a $300 sieve? Oh. Sorry they accidentally wrote ""pool"" instead of sieve on the box. First time, the box was missing half the pieces. Returned and got a new one. Set the thing up on the perfectly level ground they demand. Notice a couple rivulets of water coming from underneath. Nothing major. Never owned a pool before so maybe it's to be expected? Couple days go by. Kid has been in the pool for a total of 5 minutes. Gets out...brand new leak! Big one this time, water draining all over the place. By tomorrow it'll be completely useless.Like paying tons of money for a pool and for the water to fill it and for all the chlorine and filters only to have a giant sieve in your back yard? Like having your kid cry because their birthday present is a complete piece of garbage? Go for it!"
1,Amateur advice,If you are an amateur this book is OK. If you want more advanced advice and great pictures to look at there are better choices. The book is also very dated and needs an update to cover digital cameras.
2,Completely satisfied!,"I have long been a huge fan of Lost In Space, and now I have converted my collection from VHS to DVD."
1,Stay Away,"All this is is a motivtional book. This book is filled with all sorts of just fluff and filler. It has a little bit of fitness and food advice, but not near enough to warrent even 2 stars. I feel very [disappointed] by this book. Buyer beware, and I'm advising you to beware."
1,Save your money,The locking mechanisms are flimsy.The handle dips deep into the cake space so a two layer cake (even a thin one) won't fit. It's fine for a single layer.The bottom has cracked diagonally through the center.
1,A map,This map is just too small. Names of most streets do not appear on it which makes it useless to find exacltly where you are. Additional information such as public toilets seem a good idea until you realized that you find them everywhere in Istanbul while according to the map there is only one place for the whole city! In conclusion I found this map useful only the first day as a reminder of the layout of the city and never used it again.
1,Outdated,"Product was dry and flaky. Outdated. Maybelline had a great product in this mascara, it is a shame they have discontinued it."
2,Good product,"This seeds produced a good crop of wheatgrass without any mold on the soil. This is an indication it is really organic.Compared to other brands of seeds, these seeds were very small and produced thin blades of grass. My other brands which are supposed to be organic produce mold on the soil, so not sure what is going on. Very confusing. But for the price, you get a good dependable product and I would order from them again."
2,Great gloves for cold water sports (rafting),"I used these gloves for rafting the Colorado River 220 miles in Grand Canyong May 24-June 1. Water was very cold (40s) and gloves kept my hands dry and warm. I ordered ""small"" size, assuming men's small. I normally wear women's ""large"" and they fit perfectly. Price is very reasonable compared to other gloves I considered. Reviews were very helpful. Great product. Highly recommend them."
2,Joyful ocean journey,"I would rank Dean Evenson and Hilary Stagg up top for their uplifting joyfilled music. Ocean Dreams imprints so well the ""joy of life"" of ocean creatures and our joy at being near the ocean. The musicians play so well together and have many more outstanding CD's which take you to special places in nature. I highly recommend this CD. Incredible to listen to on earphones, you feel as though you are adrift! I also recommend Hilary Stagg - Beyond the Horizon."
1,wrong product ordered and could not cancel,"I orded the Van Halen CD which was in Japaneese by mistake. It said I could cancel at anytime, so when I reviewed my purchase and seen it was wrong I tried to cancel it and was told I couldn't cancel. I wanted to order the vinyl album. When the CD arrived it had a return slip with it. I haven't had time to return it yet, but it is a hassel for me. Amazon should not say you can cancel at anytime and then not let you.Very unsatisified,Ronda Glazier"
1,Pretty bad,"This tastes nothing like miso or ramen so I'm not sure why they bothered labeling it as such. It does turn into a soupy substance when you add your own water though. So, how does it taste you ask? Bad. Not inedibly bad but bad nonetheless. The two things that immediately popped into my mind were 1) What's the point? and 2) So this must be what meals in 3rd world prisons taste like. This is not a product for someone who actually enjoys food."
1,Nice effect but be warned...,...that the lens does not maintain the shape you select. The photos of the lens show it bent over so I thought that it would keep it's shape but was surprised when I received it--it is like a big spring that wants to return to it's normal shape. You need to keep your hands on it to maintain the position and any slight movement will change the effect. I returned it and will be buying the 3G that will allow the shape to be locked in.
1,not pleased with flow rate,"I have had this faucet about a month. The flow rate in shower mode is fine, but the regular flow has always seemed less compared to my past faucet. After two weeks of operation, the flow even got worse and has a pulsating effect. It looks nice, but am not that pleased with its operation."
2,Throw away your bubbling tablets!,"This by far and away a superior product.I've been wearing dentures for over 10 years due to cancer. My dentures only looked this good when they were brand new!No brushing, no scrubbing, 30 minute soak and YAY! Ultra-Clean.There is no comparision at all, buy this stuff!"
2,Good Book on Eastern Front Luftwaffe,"I learned a lot about the Eastern Front Luftwaffe. It is as much a study in the personalities as it is a history, strategy book."
1,I Want More Dean and Less Kemper,"For a book supposedly about Dean Kamen's quest to change the world, it is surprisingly more about the author and less about his subject. I was hoping for a great book about Dean Kamen - his work with FIRST (www.usfirst.org) and how he truly has changed at least a part of this worold. Instead I got the story of Steve Kemper. Wait for the real story."
2,Emma Stone,Besides having some great performances from Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson it has Emma Stone in it. What other reason do you need to watch this?
1,Detailed but turgid,"I had great expectations for this book, having read all of Neal Stephenson's previous books, but was disappointed by this. Although he has obviously invested immense hours in research, the book comes across as stiff and overly ornate - much like baroque design.In particular, Stephenson's smart-alecky dialogue, that worked to great effect in Snow Crash, is merely grating here, as are the anachronisms that the characters utter from time to time.As for the characters themselves, I found it very difficult to care about any of them, which made it very difficult to involve myself in the story.I really had to wonder what the benefit was of creating a gargantuan work that appeared to say so little; as if mere volume could substitute for depth."
2,Friggin Dope!,This group is hands down one of the most unique aruond. Funky Electronic beats and dope sounds through each track.
1,Useless,"It is much like a tens unit, a tens unit has pads that make your muscles jump to make them stronger in the healing process after a surgery or during rehab. It is mich like that accept the only contact point is right in the very front of the belt."
2,Garth Nix really did it this time.,"This book is about a boy named, Arthur, who recieves a key and an atlas from a mysterious man named Mister Monday. Later that week a plague hits the town, Arthur has to unravel the mysteries of the key to save his family and friends. This is a great book, I can't wait to read the second book in this series, Grim Tuesday."
1,Beastly bad film,"Concept is familiar -- man turns into a monster, not too different from old werewolf films. But this film has no appeal whatsoever. The writing and the acting are so wooden that it is impossible to care about any of the characters. It's not scary, it's not funny, it's just a boring waste of time. How did something this amateurish ever get OK'd and produced? (On the other hand, it is kind of fun to think about a double-feature pairing ""Track of the Moon Beast"" with 1959's similarly plotted but not as awful ""The Hideous Sun Demon."")"
1,"Not for action, disappointing","This case does not work well for running or other vigorous activity. Case attaches to armband with belt clip, the result is high profile and unstable and looks way un-cool overall. Maybe not bad to use with the belt clip while walking. Adds a lot of bulk to what is already a bulky player. Note that case does not look like the main photo on Amazon."
1,weird size bushings required,these require special size bushings not standard stuff & thur hard to find & ranchos service sux i'd recomend gettin another brand
1,What a mess!,"ohmigod....I love this movie, but thank God I didn't buy the Limited Edition version of the DVD. A friend of mine wasn't so lucky.I've seen it up close and I can't imagine what they were thinking. You have to play an unending stream of nightmarish games to use the DVD!The disc with the movie is easy enough to figure if you work it out logically. You'll be shown a quickly edited series of words. Then the DVD will ask you which word wasn't shown to you in the sequence. To start the movie, pick the word ""Watch"" out of the menu. Movie will play.But put in the Special Features DVD and it's just dumb luck if you find ANYTHING. In fact, by the time you see something, you'll be so annoyed you can't enjoy it.I know they were trying to simulate psychological tests or perhaps the experience of having no memory. But they went too far. It's infuriating, it's monotonous and it's not worth [the money] for the aggravation. Rent it - Don't buy it!"
1,Worse than a waste of money,"Save your money and luggage space by getting a universal adapter for the country you're visiting and plug your existing Garmin-compatible charger into that. Or just let the Garmin charge in a vehicle if you're not using only the pedestrian mode. This charger works only for the Garmin...you have to waste precious luggage space for a device that ONLY works for your Garmin and, if you get a general-purpose converter, you don't even need this item."
1,Better Pocket Books Out there,"This book is way overpriced @ $7.50. It lacks any detail whatsoever and is written at 1st year medical student level....really. Save your money and get the Tarascon critical care pocket guide, that will give you more bang for your buck."
2,I love this camera,"There are some things I wish were different, but they're relatively minor. First I'd like to say that the lack of RAW format is not a big deal. This is after all a compact, point-and-shoot camera. I get the feeling that the reviewers complaining about the lack of RAW probably wouldn't use it anyway. I think some of them just want to show off how sophisticated they are. I wish the battery could be removed without first removing the quick-release mount. I wish the grip were better, especially a place to put my thumb. The shutter is loud and a remote would be great to have. I use an inexpensive monopod for stability. The camera is tough and rugged and it takes really nice photos, and I like the included software."
2,THIS GAME IS THE LORD OF ALL VIDEO GAMES,"Activision and Neversoft have done it again. This game is sweet. The graphics ase crysal clear. There are hundreds of tricks you can pull of. And the Revert is great. You can now link vert trick. The best part are the new skaters. Like Bam Margera and the secret skater Darth Maul. Wondering about the sound track. You get Motorhead, Alien Ant Farm, The Ramones and the Red Hot Chili Peppers!"
1,"""Just ok""","Memoir was an ok book. To me the author kept going back and forth to much between cells and there was really no prison love there it was all a fantasy. Like i like him and wonder do he know i should show him i do kind of love. When and if you read it you will say to your self all he do is change cells in this book and that there really is no love story behind those bars. That is it. It's ""JUST OK"". I thought it would be similar to ""IN LOVE WITH A THUG"" but is nothing like it. That was a great book. I am currently reading ""Smoking Cigarette's"""
2,Entirely plausible theory,"Enjoyed this book very much. My only complaint is that the editing needs a lot of work. There are many, many errors in spelling, syntax, grammar and formatting."
1,The worst of RHCP,"This is a terrible album. It is quite boring and don't compare to Blood Sugar Sex Magik. They went from being totally original on BSSM and One Hot Minute to being completely generic on Californication. If you want real RHCP, listen to their old stuff."
2,Low-Carb cooking is so easy,"I purchased Low-Carb cookbook last week. I love it. I am looking forwardto purchasing more. I just wanted to thank you. I have been like many in a rut and fixing the same ole stuff day in and out. Over this past week Ihave fixed several wonderful meals using your cookbook. Thanks for adifferent approach to cooking. I could not believe how easy low-carb cooking would be. Less than seven ingredients in under 30 minutes, who could not ask for better.Lynn"
2,Short but good,"Catseye is set in a plausible post stardrive civilization, with a good portrayal of society's darker side. A young man is forced into the role of hero through his psyonic ability to ""talk"" to gengineared animal. Around this main theme is woven darker plots: exploitation of the poor, war crimes, debauchery, and government's abusing rights. It is short, sweet, and worth writing about!"
1,Required Reading,I purchased this for a class I took. Not the type of book I normally read; I will resell ASAP.
2,three stooges goofs on the loose,this dvd has color/blk and white and a must have for any three stoogesfan
2,"Okay, some good some bad","This cd has it's highlights, but not good enough for 5 stars. The songs i did like were GREAT but the ones that werent were BAD. So it's an okay cd but not great by all means, but worth the price. But, it is the best soundtrack i can think of to date."
2,Bring this book with you to mass,"My church bought new missals and I was lost because the new books don't have the full readings in it. The book has every mass word-for-word. I am a Catholic...I don't know for sure if it is for all religions, but it is exactly the Catholic mass.It also has an intro for each week so you know beforehand what mass is about. It also has a little background for each reading so you can make sense of what they are really trying to say. It does not have the songs.The church rotates the mass every year, so there are four sections to the book. All you have to do is look up in the front of the book what year/date you are currently in and find that page to go from there. I never leave this book behind on Sundays. I'm in my 20s and it's very easy to read and follow along."
1,Not Worth It,"This season is deff weak, not worth it at all. i seen season 7 and at least thats a lil bit better. But im not gonna front the last two season have really gone down since Tony Childs left!"
2,A Different Perspective,"Most documentaries on early cinema concentrate on the American based contributions of Edison, Dickson etc,. These two, specifically dealing with sound and colour, bring in a whole new cast of characters, mostly European, who made significant, if mostly forgotten contributions. Some, like the bizarre inset of a conductor at the bottom of the screen to lead the orchestra, are mind boggling but indicative of the imaginative ways used to try and overcome shortcomings. Not always well balanced, but never dull, two very interesting documentaries."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"My wife purchased this bread maker last November, thru Amazon, while we were living in Hawaii. It performed flawlessly. We have since moved to the mainland, so again purchased the same bread maker. Every loaf has been a dud. They do not rise. We have bought new flour twice, and new yeast once. Because we had this bread machine in Hawaii, and were very pleased with it, we threw away the packaging, before making the first loaf.(now I cannot return it) I did notice this machines reviews range from good to bad. Perhaps there is variability of the bread maker. And my second machine is a lemon. DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE ON THIS MACHINE."
1,An awful book,"I was going to write a long awful review of this book, but after reading some of those before me I will just echo their thoughts. Rice's first book was depressing but great. You cared about the characters and the book. His second book was less good but still an enjoyment. This book-Simply awful, too many characters, awful plot, confusing as hell. I just finished it today and thanked god it was over. This makes me hesitate to buy another one of his books."
2,Works Very Well,"I bought this item to hook up my laptop to my HDTV to watch progamming broadcast over the net (netflix, ABC, nbc, cbs, etc etc). All I can say is it does the job quite well. I can watch my programs through my tv along with a audio cable which you can also get through amazon. For the price I paid, I can't complain. I highly recommend removing it and safely storing it between uses to maintain its properly."
1,Displeased with Item,"I am the new owner of a aluratek 4 port hub. Sad to say that when I plug it into my computer while plugged into external power it shorts my usb connector and shuts down any of my 3 pc's. I suspect it is just a defective unit. I'm not going to worry about sending back, just get another one down the road. Also the cord on this thing is so short it's useless. I am very displeased with this device. I will add that it does run my portable hard drive and charge my phone at the same time w/ no external power source."
2,for a quick workout with long lasting results,it maybe only six minutes but it gives results from a 60min workout. i recommend this to anyone who dosn't like long drawn out ab workouts.
1,"Bad Writing, Bad Production, Bad Band","This is little more than a White Stripes record with Loretta Lynn singing. the playing is that of a garage band with no talent. If she wanted authenticity, she should have got musicians who actually knew how to play. the drums are weak, yet mixed way too high in the recordings, the lap guitar is feeble, the vocals are bizzare. Avoid this record if you love Loretta. If you love bad garage music, by all means pick this up immediately!!! I am desperately sorry I wasted my hard earned money on this crap."
2,Wonderful kettle,"This is a wonderful kettle. It heats quickly, looks good, and is easy to clean. It's quality is excellent. The filter in the spout is a nice feature. I hesitated to buy it because of the price, but no regrets. You will be happy with the purchase."
1,My feet bled. Seriously.,"I'm usually a big fan of Reef flip-flops, but these were very uncomfortable. The straps cut into my feet in several places. Within an hour or so of wearing them, I had blisters and some areas on the tops of my feet that were actually bleeding. Ouch! It's really a shame, because they're very cute sandals! (I have them in saddle/gold.) Maybe I should've broken them in better before I wore them outside...?"
1,Not as powerful as I wanted,"All the reviews talked about two batteries being enclosed so I purchased this mainly for the batteries and the charger to add to my trimmer. I guess at this time there is only one battery enclosed. It was what I honestly expected, not nearly as powerful as the very cheapest corded electric blower. So, if you want an extra battery and charger for any of the other items, this is for you but don't expect much from this item."
2,"Wow! My first time watching this movie, and I really love it!!!!!!!!","Forget you modern day, cheesy dance flick, American Idol starring crap musical movies! Wow! That's all I can say about this movie in one word. I love this movie! This seriously is an amazing story, based on a freakin' true story might I add! Loved it! Had everything: children in their innocent youth, a young woman becoming a lady, a sad man who didn't know what he had, and to top it off, a war! For those who have never seen this movie before, I say to you: What the f--- are you waiting for? Seriously, this movie will move you, if not, become your top 10 movies of all time. Don't be ratchet!"
1,Worst Film Comedy of All Time,"As comedies go, Tropical Thunder makes Porky's II look like something by Noel Coward. Embarrassingly tasteless and unimaginative. Not even the magnificent Robert Downey, Jr. can save it.Horrible through and through, from the script to the direction to the cast (excepting Downey). I'm still looking for someone who can explain why Ben Stiller and Jack Black are successful film comedians. Neither is a bit funny. Stiller looks okay, I guess, especially considering who his parents are, but Black doesn't have good looks or anything else going for him. He's like John Belushi without the talent.Don't even slow down to glance at this dead skunk.Jeff Huber"
1,Bad product,The Lacie 1.2T extreme was purchased to provide offline access to a about 400gig of files from a file server. There are massive delays in browsing the directories even via a cli interface. I've never experiances such a slow access time on an external hard drive as this product. It maybe good if you have a small number of large files but the seek times make this worthless for large numbers of small files.Also note the USB interface is turned off if a firewire cable is plugged in. It would of been nice for letting two machines access at once... but no luck with this. It is for single user only.
1,CIO method revised,"I just received this book today and have had it less than an hour. I'm returning it and getting my money back. The online reviews that I read were in favor of this book so I thought I would give it a chance. However, after reading a few sections and skimming others I'm not happy with it. Weissbluth has pretty much adapted the CIO method and wrote his own book. I'm just not into the CIO method and wanted other's who were reading the reveiws to know what they were getting into."
1,Not what I expected!!,"This is the first Leonard book that I have read, and it did not do much for me. I was expecting something along the lines of Hall or Hiaasen, but this did not come close. I did not care enough about any of the characters, and did not find any of them funny or interesting. I will try another Leonard novel at some point, but now I think I will check out Laurence Shames, who like Hall and Hiaasen, always makes me laugh."
2,Great Message - JESUS is the reason,"Personally, I LOVE this book, but it's not my baby's favorite. I don't know if it's because the illustrations aren't bright enough or what, but she's never taken an interest in this one like she does with her other board books that have brighter pictures - more baby friendly I guess. THe message of this book is wonderful, explaining why we give gifts. Important to let children know that JESUS is the reason for the season."
1,For trivia buffs only,"Isaac Asimov is unquestionably one of the greatest science fiction writers of the 20th century. Unfortunately, his attempts at writing mysteries did not produce the same quality of work as his efforts in SF. TALES OF THE BLACK WIDOWERS demonstrates this with puzzle after puzzle that requires knowledge of trivia (the references are sometimes painfully obscure) rather than logical deduction to solve. Trivial Pursuit players might enjoy these stories but fans of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie should pass on them."
1,Hard to play,This game is difficult in controlling the airplanes. Unless you are a very good gamer you will be discouraged.
2,Ghosts in the Vaults,"A great compilation that gives the listener a chance to return to the glory days of late '80's/early 90's Seattle. Many of the bands here I had never heard of - much less heard - but was pleasantly surprised by the discs' overall quality.If you're a fan of Nirvana, Mudhoney, Melvins, Screaming Trees, Beat Happening, etc, you'll enjoy this set, re-issued in an attractive mini faux leather box with a cool booklet. Photos by Seattle scenester Charles Peterson. Excellent; should never have been out-of-print."
2,nice looking,"I bought this for my two children 2 and 5. My 5 year old loves it and constantly is looking at it. It's very bright and colorful. I love it because it's very kid friendly. It's easy to locate places. The stand isn't very sturdy so that's why I only gave it 4 stars, but, I think I would still buy again because I think it's great for teaching kids about the world...and it was honestly the best looking one I could find out there."
2,Angelic Layer,"First of all, this editorial review is really awful. It's MISAKI, not Misaka, and HIKARU, not Hiraku. What's with the ""violence and risque humor""? This show has about as much violence and risque humor as Pokemon! If American viewers find Icchan and Misaki's slightly odd (but not icky in any way!!!) mentor/student relationship skewed or anything, then they are skewed. Icchan is WEIRD!! I AM WEIRD!! He's COMIC RELIEF! His stalkery habits are FUNNY and not at all twisted. And Misaki is a sweet, trusting, innocent little girl. This review is very disdainful and truly doesn't capture Angelic Layer for what it is: an adorable, sweet, simple but not sugary, show about believing in yourself and trying your best. It is one of my favorite shows ever."
2,"A relaxed, unstuffed-shirt approach to classical guitar.","This is a wonderfully reassuring book. I won't say it leads to ""effortless"" playing, as the cover boasts, but it certainly broadens the routine of practicing.BTW, this book was reprinted in 1991 by The Bold Strummer, Ltd., of Westport, Connecticut. It was listed in Books in Print in 1995."
2,Elixer is Bliss,These strings are very bright and sound great with my acoustic guitar. I've been looking for a good sound without the heavy string tension and this is it. Stands up to what a lot of the reviews say. Wouldn't say it is completely impenetrable from rust though... I plan to record an album with these strings!
2,"Excellent buy, easy setup","I read lot of reviews and finally decided to buy this and it's been an excellent buy for me. Easy setup, any one can do it and good range too. I bought Orinoco Gold card along with this and it is really a great product."
1,An Insult to Mozart!,It is one thing to perform Mozart on period instruments. It is another to just bang away so unmusically.I couldn't believe how horrible the 1st movement of K.310 was played. The loudness of the left hand many times made the melody played by the right hand practically inaudible. I couldn't even make out the main theme the first time through.I got so turned off that I forwarded to Mozart's earliest pieces. Here the recorded volume was so low that the background noise of the clavichord was as loud as the music itself. Raising the volume only made things worse. This was so distracting that I just had to stop playing the CD.Do not purchase!
1,The Worst Book I Have Ever Read,"Now, to be honest I found the first 2/3 of this novel very engaging if not somewhat naive, but then I arrived at the last part, ""A is A"", and everything went downhill fast. I expected an incredile conclusion full of action and adventure, maybe a train-robbing scene with pistol shooting and car jumping or a huge civil war in the valley among all the creators, but all I found were shallow characters spouting off a bunch of dull endless monologues, the majority of which seemed to imply that being a greedy selfish jerk ( sorry, a ""self-actualized person"" ) is the most moral path a person can take. In the end the ""good guys"" willingly let millions of innocent people suffer and starve to death for the sake of their muddled contradictory ""principles"". I found nothing redeeming about this book except that it makes a great paperweight and works well for smashing house spiders. Cheers-"
2,Perfect for Pancakes,I live in Brazil and bought this pan online during a trip to USA because I have 4 children who love pancakes. It survived the trip back and was well worth the effort. I never write reviews but since I just logged on to Amazon to buy a second pan (first one makes 4 small pancakes but I need to make 8 at a time with 4 kids) I thought I'd put in my comments. A great pancake pan!!
2,Worth a second glance,"350 terms carefully defined and illustrated for teens and preteens. It presents a single source to easily explain sexual terms, and it encourages useage of correct terminology."
1,Disappointing,"Having just read the author's ""The Pack"" I wanted to try another of his books. Unfortunately, the lead character in this book is the same type of loser as the protaganist in The Pack. The exception is in the former book, the character overcomes his problems, much as Jack Nicholson does in ""Wolf."" In this book, the main character never recovers and spirals ever downward."
1,Over the top,"I started out liking the book but by the time I finished I kind of lost interest. The revelation of why C.B. Whiting took his own life,etc. - it didn't ring true to me. Plus the author has everything in the book but the kitchen sink!"
2,Good light but can be finicky.,"This was the first lighter I've bought that's over $10. My main purpose for buying it was for lighting cigars, small soldering projects, and a survival lighter. It works well for the first two uses and I would imagine it would be reliable in a survival situation seeing as it has a nice cap to cover the part where the flame comes out which avoids getting water in it. The only negative thing I can say is that sometimes it misfires and the flame goes out on the lowest setting. I actually haven't had it misfire in a while but that could be in relation to the fuel level. When it's full it seems like it misfired more but now that it's under 1/2 it seems fine. I also cleaned out the torch area with a q-tip and that seemed to help too. I was lighting off fireworks with it for the 4th and I think some debris got into it and it actually wouldn't light at all. Overall it's a good quality lighter and will surely last longer than what you would find at a convenient store."
1,no didgital copy included,"I am very disappointed with Amazon. This DVD was supposed to contain a digital copy. I can't find any information how to get the copy, only to return the item."
2,This is a really good book,"Well, i thought this was a really good book but she could be more emotional about her mother dying than the scars on her hands. Other than that, the good parts were that it was a really good book and it wasnt the boring historical fiction book that i thought it would be. Definitely read it."
2,A new and different Le Carre,"Single and Single portrays the consequences for Oliver Single after his crisis of conscience. Single is a trust lawyer, with his father, for an emerging Russian Mafia family. The novel thrusts Single into a cloak and dagger world where he attempts to rescue his estranged father, and uncover the conspiracy within the conspiracy of the Russia underworld.The novel maintains tight suspense, and yet addresses issues of personal ethics and family relations. The book is really a great read, the only drawback is the lack of development among woman's characters. This weakness has little impact on the story or the message, and like some others of Le Carre's books the main character propels the story into a thought provoking struggle between ideas, as much as a struggle between people."
2,Superb at a small price.,I bought it recently and found it to be of high quality at an affordable price. Highly recommended. Comparable stuffs at local stores are much more expensive.
1,Add Me To The List Of Unhappy Customers,"Like many other people writing reviews here, this item arrived broken. The ""TOC Read"" seemed to be the problem. Amazon replaced it with no fuss. I wouldn't recommend this machine. Since it replaced a Pioneer 6 CD changer I bought way back in 1990, it's a mystery why this machine must pause to ""read"" each disc while you're standing there waiting to hear music. The shuffle play is terrible, since it heavily favors certain CDs over others, and worse, plays up to four cuts in a row from the same CD. Not my idea of random or shuffle play. The Pioneer it replaced was 15 years older technology, yet the Pioneer was superior in every way. The Pioneer's random play was awesome...no repeats, no loooong pauses to read each CD, no two cuts in a row from the same CD, and it didn't favor any one Cd over another. DON""T buy this machine."
1,yeah.... no,I am pretty sure it is Gandalf the Gray not Gandalf the Purple. It looks pretty cheesey and not very accurate.
2,Power to the People!,"I purchased the MB-D80 for my Nikon D80 camera, mainly because I was worried about charging batteries in foreign countries and running out of battery power in some out-of-the-way place. The really good news is, it comes with a plastic insert which holds 4 AA batteries to run the camera. It also takes 2 EN-EL3e rechargable batteries which will power your Nikon until the end of time! The battery door of you Nikon comes off very easily and the MB-D80 fits right in. The fit and finish is great, however it does make the camera a bit heavier. Of course with the MB-D80 installed, the camera no longer fits into it's case, but you probably suspected that. The other really good news is, the MB-D80 also works with the new Nikon D90, the successor to the D80. The D90 uses the same batteries as the D80, so it figures that the MB-D80 would be compatible. All in all, a great purchase at the typical Amazon low price. If you're going on vacation, this is a great accessory to have."
1,Terrible movie,Terrible movie. I do not think this should have had such great ratings with the critics. I could not stand any of it.
1,My poor plant,"I ordered about 7 plants from this seller, all of them were in great shape except for this one. :( The poor little plant was so squished and was browning. Sad to say it did not survive too much longer."
1,"Just buy the Intergalactic single, save some money!!","I am a long-time Beastie fan, but their newest CD is just not up to par. Sure, I like the song Intergalactic, but that is just about all I like. Their old CD's are easy to listen to over and over again, but this one gets old after the first few songs. All in all, it is not worth the 15 bucks you'll have to pay for it."
2,This workout is NOT the same as the regular one!,"I contacted Leslie's website and found that there was a batch of DVD's that were made with the wrong workouts and should have been recalled. If your DVD uses weights instead of the belt, return it or contact Leslie directly."
2,Voyage to Adventure!,"This DVD set brought back memories of watching reruns of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" on Saturday afternoons. The picture and sound quality are incredible! This was the season when the series had the ""monster of the week."" Season 3, Volume 2 is definitely full of imagination!"
2,Gateway between worlds,Understanding the path of occult practices as a way to enhance personal power - an unusual book for its genre with great appeal for students of occult science.
1,I already knew it was gonna be bad.,"This is a terrible inexcusable waste of film. These people who made this should be arrested and put in jail for stealing. Stealing the precious moment s of your life you spent watching this load of crud! Nothing original or exciting or well there is simply nothing here. Never watch this or anything else this company has put out, there all a big waste of time and money. As a matter of fact this shouldn't have been made. It's films like this that give horror flicks a bad name."
2,Amazing CD,"I have been a boingo fan for a few years, yes yes... I came in late. Better late then never. This is one of their best CDs, there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been said. It is nothing like the early boingo, but it's still amazing. Isanity, Hey, Mary, Can't See (useless).... it's all top notch musicthe only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it lacks Helpless... WHY DANNY!?!? WHY!?!But still. a solid addition to my music collection"
2,A must read for anyone in the position to influence others.,"This is the master book of influence, not just selling. All you need to learn is 8 questions that will make you more effective in presenting your product, service or idea to others.Forget anything else about selling you've ever learned... I mean everything else. Without using the 8 questions found in this book, it's all a shot in the dark anyway.This book gives you the tools to walk the path to the sale with your customer on their path... not yours. You can double, triple or even quadruple your sales effectiveness (or influence with others) by using the principles in this book."
2,Totally awesome,Washed 3 down blankets in commercial grade washers (at laudry mat). Blankets came out smelling good and apparently clean. It doesn't take much to make do the job. After washing 3 white comforters they were clean as a whistle.
2,"Great Book on Islamic Jurisprudence, But...","Don't get me wrong, this is a great book on Islamic Jurisprudence but I felt like Author could of dealt with 21st century issues more than the laws which aren't really applicable anymore... like details about Prophet Muhammad's (saw) war-booty share, etc.Author talked about Islamic way of insurances but what if there is no way of getting them where you live. I was also looking forward to learning more about interests on Mortgage payments when you can't afford to buy a house on cash. Also I wasn't really convinced with Fiqh on Meat while Halal Meat is pretty much available everywhere.Apart from these and some similar personal issues with the book, you should at least read it once to understand the Rulings better especially living in a non-Islamic country."
1,Bad Movie,Kinda slow and not much plot other than somebody trying to get an old boyfriend back.......Would probably not recommend.
1,Self Cleaning litter box too flimsy,I have owned this product for several years now and while I love the concept the execution of the design is very flawed. My major issue with this litter box is the way the top attaches to the bottom. The sliding retaining slides are way too flimsy and I broke one soon after purchasing the unit. Now I have to be careful when emptying the slide out tray so as not to spill litter all over the carpet because the top is no longer firmly attached to the bottom. Also it makes no sense that the entire right side of the box has no latches at all! Very poor design. This could be easily remedied by extending the lip on the right side of the unit and attaching two locking slides. The way this thing is presently designed it is way overpriced.
2,Excellent System,"Big bang for the buck. This system rocks, sounds terrific, and looks nice too. Good quality and great price."
1,Seems like it's just water.,"I'm totally confused by this product. It's not at all what I expected.The green tea extracts I've bought in the past (from other companies) are very dark, almost black, thicker than water and taste very strongly of green tea. This extract, by contrast, is clear and seems like water, all the way to the taste.Maybe they're doing something magical to pack concentrated green tea in there while keeping it looking and tasting like water. I can't tell, because there's no information about the concentration of actual green tea in the product. I sure hope this is more than a 2 oz bottle of weak green tea.At this price, I want to know that I am getting the health benefits of concentrated green tea. I think I'll be returning this."
1,What a piece of junk,"This album is very popular among high school students and some stupid college kids. It is not the greatest album in the world being both musically complex and great. It is instead a mere pop album and I think it sucks. If you want to listen to what everyone else likes, buy this album, if not, DON'T."
2,It is aging well,"Though the first time I heard this, it sounded too much like Sid Barrett from Pink Floyd, but there are other influences too.It does seem to be standing in some aesthetic dignity, and it makes U want to play guitar.Though Blur split up, and Gorillaz was formed, this reassuringly does not try to impress.Life goes on...and for u."
